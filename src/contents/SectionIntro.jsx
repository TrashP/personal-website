        Hi there! I'm Arnab, an aspiring web dev. I'm moving towards a new
        direction in my career and my life. For the past year, I've been
        self-learning CS and web dev is the area that really excites me.
        Creating new user experiences, implementing eye pleasing designs, and
        making them come to life with animations is what I do best. I hope to
        continue learning more and more about this profession and build my
        career in this field. I'm currently looking for opportunities to work as
        a web developer. Contact me if you think I'm up for the challenge.Hi
